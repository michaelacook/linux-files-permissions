# Files 

## What is a file?
- A file is a chunk of data that contains text or binary data like graphics and audio files
- Many formats for different types of data
- File system - structure data in ways that makes it easier to find files
- Linux inherited Unix philosophy that everything is a file, including devices
    -Regular files 
        -binary or text 
        - saved on a storage device, read and written to depending on permissions 
        - files also have meta-data so the operating system knows what type of file it is
          - type of file 
          - permissions 
          - size 
          - creation data 
    - Directory file 
      - list of other files, organizes the system
      - reading the file is reading a list of other files
      - associates data blocks with file names
    - Devices 
      - printers, screens, storage devices, and every other device is represented in the OS as a file  
        - Block Device File
          - drivers communicate by sending blocks of data
          - ie. harddisks, ssds, USB cameras
        - Character Device File 
          - drivers communicate by sending single characters (bytes, octets)
          - ie. serial ports, parallel ports, sound cards, keyboards, printers
          - writing data to the printer file sends that data to the printer
          - Can be virtual files, not representing a real device at all 
            - ie. `/dev/zero` device is a virtual device that outputs an endless supply of zeros
              - Could be used to wipe a hard drive by writing zeros to it
            - `/dev/null` is a virtual device that swallows everything written to it, making it disappear
              - Can write output from a command to the null device and it won't be outputted
    - Virtual Files 
      - files that don't exist anywhere, but can be read and written to (weird)
        - ie. `/proc/cpuinfo`
          - has a size of 0 bytes, created on the fly by the OS
    - Pipe File 
      - Output of an application is a file that hasn't been saved yet
      - A pipe file can allow one application to read data from another completely unrelated application
      - As one application writes data to the pipe file, the other application reads data from it
- Everything being a file allows you view important system info and write data to devices with simple tools
- It allows simple tools to be combined to solve more complex problems by sharing data in pipe files, all without additional software
